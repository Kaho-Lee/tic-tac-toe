For this final project, we decided to make a arduino version of tic tac toe.
This game has two mode. One is the traditional human vs humnan. This program can
decide which side can winning part. Second mode is human vs computer. We create a
simple AI by using the minmax algarithm.

Acknowledgment
Thanks for your help on the minmax algarism Chen Ma
We also learn the algarithm from
wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax
Youtube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik

Milestone:
This time we tried to use the minmax algarithm to build up a really simple AI.
This algarithm will go throw all the possiblity and choose the best move for the
computer.We most difficult part is to understand the recursion function.

The second milestone is create a button to regret one step.

Future improvement:
Overall, the speed of the code is acceptable. Due to the time limitation, we didn't
add the alpha-beta pruning.  Basically, alpha-beta pruning is to cut off some meaningless
brunch which can increase the running time.

How to play:
Main menu:
potential meter: Red light (pin 13) not very smart ( give computer chance to win)
                 Green light (pin 12) smart (you can't beat it )
Joy stick : select mode
            press button to confirm the mode
Mode:"man vs comp"
Human : "o" and always go first.
Computer : "x" go second

Mode:"man vs man"
first one :"o"
Second one :"x"

In both mode, people can regret one step by press button (pin 11)

After game, press button (pin 3) to go back to main menu
